Features
Extracts text from uploaded images.
Supports multiple languages (Hindi and English).
Uses deep learning models from Hugging Face.
Simple, user-friendly implementation using Python.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Hugging Face Transformers
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Tesseract (for language support)
Torch
